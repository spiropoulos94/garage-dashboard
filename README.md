## How to run the project in mock state

Login with email ```email``` and password as ```password``` to see the project live.

## App Router folder naming convention

We are using the

```bash
(auth)
```

and

```bash
(dashboard)
```

routes inside the App Router. Routes in brackets are ignored by NextJS router. We follow this convention in order to semantically group the routes in two categories.

- (auth) includes the routes that the user should be able to access when NOT authenticated (e.g /login, /register etc)
- (dashboard) includes the main application routes that should be accessible upon authentiction

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
